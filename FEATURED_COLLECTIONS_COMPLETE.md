## 💡 Tips

### Best Practices
- **Image Size**: Use high-quality images (1200x800px or larger)
- **File Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB for fast loading
- **Aspect Ratio**: 3:2 or 4:3 works best

### Organizing Collections
- collection-1: Your most important collection
- collection-2: Second most important
- etc.
- Collections display in order (1, 2, 3, 4...)

### Adding Titles & Descriptions
Currently, collections use default titles. In a future update, you can:
- Add custom titles for each collection
- Add custom descriptions
- Link to specific collection pages

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

1. ✅ Upload 6 default collections
2. ✅ Add more collections (7, 8, 9, 10, unlimited!)
3. ✅ Replace any collection image
4. ✅ Delete collections you don't want
5. ✅ See changes live on homepage immediately
