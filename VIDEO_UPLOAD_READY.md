## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **File Size Limits:**
- Images: Max 10MB
- Videos: Max 50MB

### **Recommendations:**
- Use **MP4 format** for best compatibility
- **Compress videos** before uploading if they're large
- Keep videos **under 30 seconds** for web performance
- Use **1080p or 720p** resolution (not 4K)

### **For Larger Videos:**
If you need videos larger than 50MB, consider:
- Compressing the video
- Using YouTube/Vimeo embeds instead
- Splitting into shorter clips

## 🎬 Video Compression Tips

### **Free Tools:**
- **HandBrake** (desktop app)
- **CloudConvert** (online)
- **FFmpeg** (command line)

### **Quick FFmpeg Command:**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec h264 -acodec aac -b:v 2M output.mp4
```

This compresses video to ~2Mbps bitrate, good for web.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Video won't upload:**
- Check file size (must be under 50MB)

- Refresh the page (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### **Video uploads but doesn't play:**
- MP4 format is most compatible
- Make sure video codec is H.264
- Check if video plays in browser directly
