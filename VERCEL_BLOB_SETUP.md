# 🎉 Switched to Vercel Blob Storage (No Cloudinary Needed!)

## ✅ What Changed

I've replaced Cloudinary with **Vercel Blob Storage** which is:
- ✅ **Free** (100GB bandwidth/month on hobby plan)
- ✅ **Simple** - No complex configuration
- ✅ **Reliable** - Built by Vercel for Next.js
- ✅ **Works locally** - Falls back to local storage in development

---

## 🚀 Local Development (Already Working!)

**For local testing, images are saved to `public/uploads/` folder.**

No configuration needed! Just upload images and they'll work.

---

## 🌐 For Vercel Production Deployment

### Step 1: Enable Vercel Blob Storage

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on **Storage** tab
3. Click **Create Database** or **Connect Store**
4. Select **Blob**
5. Click **Create**

This will automatically add the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable.

### Step 2: Redeploy

After enabling Blob storage:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **⋮** on latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**

That's it! Image uploads will now work in production.
