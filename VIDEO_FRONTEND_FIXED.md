# ✅ Video Display on Frontend FIXED!

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Smart Detection:**

The component checks the file extension:

```typescript
currentSlideData.mainImage.match(/\.(mp4|webm|mov|avi)$/i)
```

**If video:** Uses `<video>` element  
**If image:** Uses `<Image>` component

### **Video Element:**
```html
<video
  src={url}
  autoPlay
  loop
  muted
  playsInline
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
/>
```

## 📁 File Structure

### **Where Videos Are Stored:**

**Local:** `/public/uploads/hero/{timestamp}-{filename}.mp4`  
**Production:** Vercel Blob Storage URL

### **How They're Loaded:**

1. Admin uploads video to hero section
2. Video saved to database with URL
3. Hero component fetches from `/api/site-images?section=hero`
4. Component detects video extension
5. Displays with video player

---

## ✅ Complete Flow

### **1. Upload (Admin Dashboard):**
- Select Hero section
- Upload video file
- Success: "Video uploaded successfully"
- Video shows in preview with controls

### **2. Display (Frontend):**
- Homepage loads
- Fetches hero images/videos
- Detects video files
- Displays with autoplay

## 🎬 Video Best Practices

### **For Hero Section:**

**Recommended:**
- ✅ Duration: 10-30 seconds
- ✅ Resolution: 1080p (1920x1080)
- ✅ Format: MP4 (H.264)
- ✅ File size: Under 20MB
- ✅ Content: Loopable (seamless loop)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Very long videos (>1 minute)
- ❌ Large file sizes (>50MB)
- ❌ Videos with important audio
- ❌ 4K resolution (too large)

### **Optimization Tips:**

1. **Compress videos** before uploading
2. **Use H.264 codec** for MP4
3. **Keep it short** for faster loading
4. **Test on mobile** devices
5. **Make it loop seamlessly**
