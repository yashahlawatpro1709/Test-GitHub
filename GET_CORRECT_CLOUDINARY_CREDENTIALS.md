# üîç How to Get Correct Cloudinary Credentials

## ‚ùå Current Issue

Your upload is failing with: **"Invalid cloud_name dqnffonkq"**

This means one or more of your Cloudinary credentials are incorrect.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Find Correct Credentials

### Step 1: Go to Cloudinary Dashboard

1. Open: https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Login to your account
3. You should see the **Dashboard** page

### Step 2: Find Your Credentials

On the Dashboard page, look for a section called **"Product Environment Credentials"** or **"Account Details"**.

You'll see something like this:

```
Cloud name: your-actual-cloud-name
API Key: 123456789012345
API Secret: AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
```

### Step 3: Copy the EXACT Values

**IMPORTANT:** Copy these values EXACTLY as shown (no extra spaces, no quotes):

1. **Cloud Name** - This is usually a random string like `dxyz123abc` or your custom name
2. **API Key** - A number like `134633341723411`
3. **API Secret** - A long string like `4a7BDn1nr7dfKpVlJv1QyHiLZBM`

## üîß Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Wrong: Using the URL format
```
cloudinary://134633341723411:4a7BDn1nr7dfKpVlJv1QyHiLZBM@dqnffonkq
```

### ‚úÖ Correct: Using individual values
```
Cloud Name: dqnffonkq
API Key: 134633341723411
API Secret: 4a7BDn1nr7dfKpVlJv1QyHiLZBM
```

---

## üì∏ What to Look For

In your Cloudinary dashboard, you should see:

1. **Top of the page** - Your cloud name in the URL or header
2. **Product Environment Settings** section
3. **API Keys** tab (if you clicked on it in the screenshot)

The screenshot you shared showed the **API Keys** page with:
- Key Name: "Root"
- API Key: 134633341723411
- API Secret: 4a7BDn1nr7dfKpVlJv1QyHiLZBM (partially hidden)

But we need to verify the **Cloud Name**.

## üéØ Quick Fix

### Option 1: Check Cloud Name in URL

When you're logged into Cloudinary, look at the browser URL:
```
https://console.cloudinary.com/console/c-XXXXX/media_library/folders/home
                                        ^^^^^^
                                    This might be your cloud ID
```

But the cloud NAME is different from cloud ID.

### Option 2: Check in Dashboard

1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Look at the top-left corner or settings
3. Find "Cloud name" field
4. Copy the EXACT value

### Option 3: Check in Settings

1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/account
2. Look for "Cloud name" under Account Details
3. Copy the value

---

## üîÑ Update Your Credentials

Once you have the correct cloud name:

### For Local Development:

Edit `.env.local`:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-correct-cloud-name-here"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="134633341723411"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="4a7BDn1nr7dfKpVlJv1QyHiLZBM"
```

Then restart the dev server:
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### For Vercel Production:

1. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Find `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
3. Click Edit
4. Update with correct value
5. Save
6. Redeploy

---

## üß™ Test Your Credentials

After updating, run:
```bash
node test-cloudinary.js
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS! Cloudinary connection works!
```

---

## üìã What I Need From You

Please go to your Cloudinary dashboard and tell me:

1. **What is the exact Cloud Name?** (from Dashboard or Settings)
2. **Confirm the API Key:** Is it `134633341723411`?
3. **Confirm the API Secret:** Does it start with `4a7BDn1nr7d`?

Once you provide the correct cloud name, I'll update the configuration for you.

---

## üí° Alternative: Create New API Key

If you're unsure about the credentials:

1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/api-keys
2. Click "Generate New API Key"
3. Copy all three values (Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret)
4. Use those instead

This ensures you have fresh, correct credentials.
